## Description

Talli is a MERN stack single-page application created to record expenses incurred on behalf of a group and to facilitate splitting the amount of the expense between all group members. This can be a single expense, for example a meal, or multiple expenses for example a holiday. The application records who made the payment and what the payment was for.
